This program utilizes a API link to randomly generate a Dinosaur name, that then gets a random vowel removed. The player then has to guess which vowel has been removed. This program was made with Webpacks, JavaScript, and API links.
### BDD Process

      * **Input**: "Click"
      * **Output**: "Technosaurus"
2. Have a random vowel removed from the dinosaur name.
      * **Input**: Technosaurus
      * **Output**: Technosa-r-s
3. User selects which vowel is missing, and then submit answer
      * **Input**: select a
      * **Output**: submit
4. Displays correct spelling, and weather or no the user is correct.
      * **Input**: Technosaurus, "user selected a"
      * **Output**: sorry, wrong answer!
